# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Clipper is a free and open source clipboard management system. This privacy policy explains how Clipper handles your data.

## Data Collection

**Clipper does not collect any user information.**

- No personal data is collected
- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No tracking of any kind
- No data is transmitted to external servers

## Data Storage

All clipboard data you save with Clipper is stored **locally on your own device** or on a server that **you control**:

- When using the desktop application, data is stored in your local database
- When using the server component, data is stored on your self-hosted server
- No data is ever sent to Clipper developers or any third parties

## Open Source

Clipper is completely open source. You can:

- Review the source code to verify these privacy claims
- Audit exactly what the software does with your data
- Modify the software to suit your needs

## Third-Party Services

Clipper does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. If you choose to deploy Clipper on a cloud provider, that provider's privacy policy would apply to the infrastructure, but Clipper itself does not share any data with external services.

## Clip Sharing Feature

If you use the optional clip sharing feature (short URLs), shared clips are accessible via the URL you generate. This is an opt-in feature that you control:

- Only clips you explicitly choose to share are accessible
- Shared links expire (default: 24 hours)
- Sharing is disabled by default

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in updates to this document in the source repository.
